#CommitGPT: A ChatGPT-powered Commit Message Generator

This repository contains the source code for CommitGPT, a tool that helps you create commit messages using the OpenAI ChatGPT API. It uses the GPT-4 architecture and provides a simple CLI interface for generating commit messages based on the staged changes in a Git repository.

## Features

- Generate multiple suggestions for commit messages based on staged changes in the repository.
- Choose from different ChatGPT models.
- Customize the number of suggestions, tokens, and other options.
- Interactive selection of the generated commit messages.

## Prerequisites

To use CommitGPT, you need:

- An OpenAI API key. You can create one by visiting [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- Rust programming language installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Install from crates.io

```
cargo install commitgpt
```

2. Create the configuration file:
    
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/commitgpt
touch ~/.config/commitgpt/config.toml
```

3. Add your OpenAI API key to the configuration file:

```bash
echo 'api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"' > ~/.config/commitgpt/config.toml
```

## Usage

1. Stage your changes in a Git repository using `git add`.
2. Run CommitGPT to generate commit message suggestions:

```bash
codecommitgpt
```

3. Pick a commit message from the generated suggestions, or exit the selection prompt to cancel.
4. Optionally, edit the commit message and save to complete the commit process.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of CommitGPT using command-line options. For example, to generate 7 commit message suggestions and limit the message length to 300 tokens, run:

```bash
commitgpt -s 7 -t 300
```

For more options, run `commitgpt --help`.
